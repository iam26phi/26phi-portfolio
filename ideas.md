  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Minimalism (Mono-Brutalism)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Authenticity**: Unapologetic use of space and contrast to mirror the "havoc of living" motto.
  2. **Structural Tension**: Asymmetric layouts that create visual tension, reflecting the dynamic nature of street and portrait photography.
  3. **Content-First**: The interface recedes completely; images are the only "color" in a monochrome world.
  4. **Directness**: No decorative fluff; interactions are immediate and sharp.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Void Black (#050505)**: The canvas, representing the "havoc" or the unknown.
  - **Stark White (#FAFAFA)**: The "dream" and "relief," used for typography and key interactive elements.
  - **Neutral Gray (#404040)**: For secondary information, blending into the background to keep focus on the art.
  - *Reasoning*: A high-contrast black-and-white scheme amplifies the emotional weight of the photography and aligns with the "26phi" persona.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Masonry with Disruption**: A masonry grid that occasionally breaks rhythm with full-width hero images or offset text blocks.
  - **Sticky Typography**: Large, sticky section headers that remain visible as users scroll through the gallery, grounding the experience.
  - **Overlay Navigation**: A minimal, always-accessible menu that overlays content without obscuring it, perhaps using a "glassmorphism" effect but strictly in monochrome.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Monospace Typography**: Using a high-quality monospace font for metadata (dates, locations) to evoke a "archival" or "technical" feel.
  - **Thin Line Dividers**: Hairline 1px white borders to separate sections, reminiscent of contact sheets or film frames.
  - **Hover Inversion**: Images invert or gain a high-contrast filter on hover before revealing the full color/detail on click.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap Scroll**: Sections snap into place with a heavy, deliberate feel.
  - **Cursor Reaction**: The cursor might invert colors based on the background or expand when hovering over clickable elements.

  **Animation**:
  - **Reveal on Scroll**: Images slide up with a slight delay (staggered) as they enter the viewport.
  - **Text Scramble**: Headlines decode or scramble into view, adding a "digital/glitch" aesthetic that fits the modern, edgy vibe.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: *Space Grotesk* or *Syne* (Bold/ExtraBold) – for impact and headlines.
  - **Body/Meta**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Space Mono* – for that technical, raw feel.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Noir (Soft Dark Mode)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Dreamlike Atmosphere**: Reflecting the "dream is the only relief" motto with soft blurs and glows.
  2. **Fluidity**: Layouts that flow like water, with smooth transitions and organic spacing.
  3. **Intimacy**: A focus on the subject, creating a personal connection between the viewer and the photo.
  4. **Subtlety**: Interactions are gentle, inviting rather than demanding attention.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Charcoal (#121212)**: Softer than pure black, providing a rich, warm depth.
  - **Mist White (#E0E0E0)**: Slightly muted white for text to reduce eye strain and enhance the "dreamy" vibe.
  - **Shadow Black (#000000)**: Used for depth and layering.
  - *Reasoning*: Creates a cinematic, gallery-like environment where photos seem to emerge from the darkness.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Horizontal Scroll Gallery**: A side-scrolling main gallery that mimics a film strip or an exhibition walk-through.
  - **Central Focus**: Hero images are centered with generous negative space, forcing the eye to rest on them.
  - **Floating Elements**: Text and buttons float above the background with subtle drop shadows or glows.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Grain/Noise Texture**: A subtle film grain overlay on the entire site to unify digital and analog aesthetics.
  - **Glow Effects**: Soft, white glows behind active elements or selected images.
  - **Serif Typography**: Elegant, high-contrast serif fonts for headings to add a touch of classic sophistication.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Parallax**: Background elements move slower than foreground content, creating depth.
  - **Fade Transitions**: Page loads and image changes happen with slow, deliberate fades.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Zoom**: Hero images slowly zoom in or pan, bringing the still photos to life.
  - **Blur-in**: Text and images blur into focus upon entry.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: *Playfair Display* or *Cormorant Garamond* (Italic/Regular) – for elegance.
  - **Body**: *Inter* or *Lato* (Light) – for clean, unobtrusive reading.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss International Style (Dark Edition)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Precision**: Everything aligns to a strict, visible or invisible grid system.
  2. **Objective Clarity**: Information is presented without emotional embellishment, letting the photos speak.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Balancing heavy imagery with negative space and typographic weight.
  4. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold type is treated as a visual element equal to photography.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Matte Black (#1A1A1A)**: A flat, non-reflective background.
  - **Swiss Red (#FF3B30)**: A single accent color used *very* sparingly (e.g., for the active state or a "Book Now" dot).
  - **Pure White (#FFFFFF)**: For text and grid lines.
  - *Reasoning*: A classic, timeless aesthetic that frames the photography professionally and cleanly.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A flexible grid where images can span 1, 2, or 3 columns.
  - **Split Screen**: Hero section splits the screen between a large portrait and a bold typographic statement.
  - **Vertical Rhythm**: Strict adherence to a baseline grid for typography.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Visible Grid Lines**: Subtle, dark gray lines separating content areas.
  - **Huge Typography**: Oversized headings that crop off-screen or overlap images slightly.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles or squares used as buttons or decorative anchors.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Reveal**: Hovering over a menu item reveals a preview image related to that category.
  - **Instant Response**: No lag or drag; clicks are immediate.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide-up**: Content slides up from the bottom with a crisp easing curve.
  - **Masking**: Images are revealed by sliding masks (curtains) away.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: *Helvetica Now* or *Neue Haas Grotesk* (Bold/Black) – the gold standard.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* or *Arial* – neutral and functional.
